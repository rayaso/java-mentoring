//this is an exemple for regullar array:

        int[] l = new int[3];//number 3 means that we have 3 variables

        l[0] = 10;
        l[1] = 20;
        l[2] = 30;

        for (int a : l) {//i created new int and when i call a go inside l so loop for everything inside l
            //we are looping for eatch variable inside l,print all vules line by line

            System.out.println(a);
